/* Disallowed extensions for file uploads. If anyone gains unauthorized
access to your admin center, or one of your admins decides to go 
the-internet-equivalent-of-postal, they can upload a script file using 
the Add File function and run it in their browser, which can allow them 
to do very, very bad things to your paFileDB, website, and entire server.
You can use the disallowed extensions to prevent the uploading of various 
script types, such as PHP. It is recommended that you do not remove any
of the extensions in this list, and if you want to upload a script for 
others to download, it's best to zip it first.

Separate extensions by a space, and do not add the period before them.
